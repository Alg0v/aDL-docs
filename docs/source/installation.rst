Installation
=====

To use aDL on your C++ project, you must do the following steps:

- **Download the source code** : https://github.com/Alg0v/aDL

- Move the files in a directory **inside your project** (for example, create a directory named lib and paste all files)

- Add all the executables from the library to **your project's compiling target** (for example, for CMAKE, add "add_executable([project] [aDL dir]/aDL.h [aDL dir]/config.h [aDL dir]/sprite.h [aDL dir]/commons.h [aDL dir]/video.h [aDL dir]/audio.h [aDL dir]/text.h [aDL dir]/video.h)" to CMakeLists.txt

You can now use aDL !
